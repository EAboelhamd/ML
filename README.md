# QMSS Data Mining

This repository contains my R codes related to the Data Mining for Social Sciences course at Columbia (Prof Ben Goodrich). 

*Optimization, PCR, Classification*:
Assignment tasks are to optimize a loss function in R; run a PCR model; and explore the best model for classifying a binary outcome.

*Smoothing, Trees:*
Assignment tasks are to fit a generalized additive regression model (GAM); run and compare different tree-based classification models (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest).  

*Neural Nets, bartMachine:*
Assignment tasks are to fit a neural networks model by varying the number of hidden layers; run and compare this and other models (including bartMachine) in prediction accuracy, based on Mean Squared Error.

*Final Project:*
The KDD competition task is a classification problem where the goal is to estimate the response (donate vs no donate) to a direct mailing program. This data set was used for The Second International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition. Collaborator: Arnold Lau.
